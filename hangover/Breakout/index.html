        <p>Zoom University gets a lot of flak, but it isn’t completely awful: Any student could probably name at least  
            one thing they like about remote classes. For some, it’s the fact that they don’t have to walk 20 minutes to  get to class anymore. For others, it might be an appreciation for the flexibility of asynchronous lectures.  And for that one guy in my psychology class, it’s probably the fact that he can hit a fat vape from the comfort of  his home while learning about the functions of the amygdala. 
        </p>
            <p>However, I’d wager that nobody likes Zoom breakout sessions. </p>
            <p>
            Breakout sessions are a lot like Russian roulette: You never quite know what you’re going to get. Sometimes,  you’ll catch a break: a breakout session with your one (1) friend in the class. Other times, you’re not so lucky: a  group of strangers who probably wouldn’t talk to you even if your life depended on it. But fear not! With this guide, you will learn to navigate even the most unbearable of Zoom breakout sessions.

        <h4 class="situation-subhed">You're supposed to discuss last night's reading for 10 minutes. Two people have their mic muted. Two others don't even have their camera on. You're pretty sure one guy is on the toilet. What do you do?</h4>

        <img src="https://northbynorthwestern.com/content/images/2020/12/SacrificialLamb.png" class="breakout-illo">
        <p><strong>BE THE SACRIFICIAL LAMB:</strong> You know Iron Man in Avengers: Endgame? Or that one  
            guy with the cross from way back when? Yeah, you’re the Zoom equivalent of those  guys. Be the first to discuss whatever prompt you’ve been given in the hopes that  someone takes pity on your poor soul and engages with you. 
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>MAKE SMALL TALK:</strong> As a wise man once said, “You gotta butter up your  
                biscuits before you put them in the oven” (Source: Dude, trust me). Similarly,  
                sometimes it takes a little small talk to warm people up to discussing the meaty topics  of academia. Talk about the weather. What you had for dinner. The crushing weight of  the responsibility to change the world for the better. You know, the small stuff.                 
                </p>
            <h4 class="text-subhead">DON'Ts</h4>
            <p><strong>STAY SILENT</strong> Think about it this way. You are a god amongst men. Your classmates are sheep waiting for a command from your divine lips. If you don’t speak, what hope can you have that your classmates will?            
                </p>
                <p><strong>STAY SILENT, BUT LEAVE YOUR MIC UNMUTED</strong> What’s worse than the deafening silence of nobody wanting  to talk to each other? The deafening silence of nobody wanting to talk to each other, with the uncomfortable  background sounds of your breathing, sniffing, etc. Unless you’re an aspiring ASMR creator (and if you are, I wish  you nothing but the best), please leave your mic muted if you’re not going to say anything.

        <header class="section-head"><img src="https://northbynorthwestern.com/content/images/2020/12/Situation2.png" class="situation-text" alt=""><h3 class="situation-heading"><strong>Technical</strong> difficulties!</h3>
        <h4 class="situation-subhed">Someone in your breakout room has an awful connection, but they don’t know it. Their video feed consists of no more  than eight pixels at any given time. A flipbook animation would put their frame rate to shame. Their audio sounds like  someone recorded Morse code with a taser and then set that recording on fire. But they keep trying to communicate  with the rest of the breakout room. What do you do? 
        </h4></header>
        <h4 class="text-subhead">DO</h4>
        <img src="https://northbynorthwestern.com/content/images/2020/12/Keyboard.png" class="breakout-illo">
        <p><strong>USE YOUR DAMN KEYBOARD:</strong> Believe it or not, there are uses for the Zoom chat other  than privately complaining about the lecture to your friend or desperately trying to signal  to the professor that they’re not sharing the PowerPoint (for the fifth time). In fact,  the Zoom chat is great for signaling to your fellow Zoommates that their Internet  connection has rendered them an incomprehensible robot. 
        </p>
        <h4 class="text-subhead">DON'T</h4>
        <p><strong>ATTEMPT TO SPEAK THEIR LANGUAGE:</strong> Maybe, for whatever reason, you think that your communication  skills are exceptional enough to communicate with the guy who’s trying to tune into the Zoom call from his  toaster. Let me assure you that no amount of patience or repeated “Huh? What’d you say?”s will allow you to  understand the robotic, static-filled cries of a person with shitty WiFi. 
        </p>
        <header class="section-head"><img src="https://northbynorthwestern.com/content/images/2020/12/Situation3.png" class="situation-text" alt=""><h3 class="situation-heading">A wild <strong>professor</strong> has appeared!
        <h4 class="situation-subhed">You’ve finished discussing the necessary topics with your Zoommates. Naturally, you now start discussing some  of the more pressing, important topics of life with your peers: life, love, optimal Among Us gameplay strategies, etc.  Suddenly, your professor quietly slinks into the breakout room while you are all clearly off task! What do you do?</h4></header>
        <h4 class="text-subhead">DOs</h4>
        <p><strong>ALERT! ALERT!:</strong> Just as Paul Revere alerted the American colonies of the British’s impending arrival, so too  must you alert your peers of your professor’s arrival. The key is subtlety: “Why, PROFESSOR [insert professor  name here], how nice of you to join us in this delightful Zoom breakout session!”         </p>
        <p><strong>HIT THAT HARD PIVOT:</strong> If you’ve ever watched a presidential debate, you know the power of the  conversational pivot. With a simple utterance of, “Yeah! But as I was saying…” you can steer whatever wayward  conversation you were having with your peers back into the professor-approved discourse you were actually  meant to be having. </p>
        <h4 class="text-subhead">DON'T</h4>
        <img src="https://northbynorthwestern.com/content/images/2020/12/DarthVader.png" class="breakout-illo">
        <strong>BE A BYSTANDER:</strong> You know that scene in Star Wars: Return of the Jedi where Palpatine is shocking the bejesus out of Luke for like a solid minute and Vader is just kind of … standing there doing nothing? If you do nothing and watch as your classmates goof off in front of the professor, you’re basically Darth Vader. And he was a pretty bad guy. </p>

        <header class="section-head"><img src="https://northbynorthwestern.com/content/images/2020/12/Situation4.png" class="situation-text" alt=""><h3 class="situation-heading"><strong>Wait</strong>, what is this class again?</h3>
        <h4 class="situation-subhed">Sometimes, there are more pressing issues than a Zoom lecture — like constantly staring at yourself in the Zoom  panel to make sure that you’re striking that perfect balance between looking pretty but also looking like you’re  actually paying attention to class. Regardless, now you’re in a breakout room with three strangers, and you have no  idea what they’re talking about. What do you do? 
        </h4>
        </header>
        <h4 class="text-subhead">DO</h4>
        <p><strong>CONFESS YOUR SINS:</strong> Generally speaking, you will be amongst peers in a Zoom breakout session — fellow  brothers and sisters in the struggle against Big Academia. Here, there is no shame in admitting that you have  no idea what’s going on. In fact, doing so usually puts everyone at ease, and everybody likes to feel smart by  explaining something to a dumbass. </p>
        <h4 class="text-subhead">DON'T</h4>
        <img src="https://northbynorthwestern.com/content/images/2020/12/Sus.png" class="breakout-illo">
        <p><strong>FAKE IT UNTIL YOU MAKE IT:</strong> Chances are, even if you haven’t been paying attention to the lecture at all, your classmates don’t have that much of a better  grasp on the subject matter than you do. Trying to fake  your way through a discussion by spewing nonsense  is more likely to confuse the others than convince  them that you know what you’re talking about. It’s usually better (and easier) to just be carried through a discussion by those who actually did the reading.
